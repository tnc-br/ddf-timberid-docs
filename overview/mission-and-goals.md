## **Components**

TimberID has three high level components:

1. A Web UI is used to track and store both reference and untrusted samples (Isotope Tracking frontend)

3. A backend analytics engine that runs on seized timber to perform origin verification and other analysis (Insights and Analytics)

The fourth component shown above, the Transparency Application is a future application under the Digitais da Floresta platform that uses the generated insights from TimberID (along with other insights) to create actional insights for target users.
