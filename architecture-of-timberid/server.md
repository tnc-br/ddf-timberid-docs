### Database design&#x20;

The database is a [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) Database. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database. It leverages Firebase Authentication to eliminate a middle tier and allow secure direct read/writes from the front end.

The development database can be found [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/-default-/data/query;collection=%2Fnew\_users?authuser=0\&project=river-sky-386919). The production database can be found [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/-default-/data/query;collection=%2Fnew\_users?authuser=0\&project=timberid-prd).

The schema of the database is below.
